Final project for the Modeling and Simulation 2025-1 class, designed and developed at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), specifically at its National School of Higher Studies, Morelia Campus (ENES Morelia). This project is an integral component of the Bachelor's in Information Technologies for Science curriculum.

## Introduction
Every year on Christmas Eve, Santa Claus embarks on a magical journey, flying across the night sky in his sleigh pulled by eight reindeer, tasked with delivering gifts to children all around the world. It's a feat that seems impossible—visiting every single house in just one night, spreading joy and wonder across the globe. Yet, through the magic of Christmas and a little help from clever logistics, Santa always finds a way.

This project simulates Santa Claus's gift delivery logistics on Christmas Eve using graph theory. The primary goal is to model and optimize Santa’s route to ensure that all gifts are delivered on time to every single house. By leveraging graph-based algorithms, the simulation addresses complex logistical challenges, such as minimizing travel time, or finding the most efficient paths across various regions. Through this model, we explore how Santa can accomplish this seemingly impossible task in a single night, combining elements of pathfinding, optimization, and real-world constraints.

## Objectives

- Try to simulate all of Santa's required metrics in order to "realistically" make christmas happen.
- Make use of the best path possible for route optimization through graph search algorithms sucj as A*.
- Use physics formulas to replicate Santa's job journey as down to earth as possible.
- Take into account real life problems such as weight, speed and force necessary to move Santa's sleigh.
